# SQLAlchemy Homework - Surfs Up!

![surfs-up.png](Images/surfs-up.png)

I decided to treat myself to a long holiday vacation in Honolulu, Hawaii! To help with my trip planning, I need to do some climate analysis on the area. The following outlines what I need to do.

## Step 1 - Climate Analysis and Exploration

To begin, I used Python and SQLAlchemy to do basic climate analysis and data exploration of my climate database. All of the following analysis were completed using SQLAlchemy ORM queries, Pandas, and Matplotlib.

* starterted notebook(climate_starter.ipynb) and [hawaii.sqlite](Resources/hawaii.sqlite) files to complete my climate analysis and data exploration.

* Chose a start date and end date for my trip. Make sure that your vacation range is approximately 3-15 days total.

* Used SQLAlchemy `create_engine` to connect to my sqlite database.

* Used SQLAlchemy `automap_base()` to reflect my tables into classes and save a reference to those classes called `Station` and `Measurement`.

### Precipitation Analysis

* Designed a query to retrieve the last 12 months of precipitation data.

* Selected only the `date` and `prcp` values.

* Loaded the query results into a Pandas DataFrame and set the index to the date column.

* Sorted the DataFrame values by `date`.

* Ploted the results using the DataFrame `plot` method.

* Used Pandas to print the summary statistics for the precipitation data.

### Station Analysis

* Designed a query to calculate the total number of stations.

* Designed a query to find the most active stations.

  * Listed the stations and observation counts in descending order.

  * Which station has the highest number of observations?

  * Hint: I used functions such as `func.min`, `func.max`, `func.avg`, and `func.count` in your queries.

* Designed a query to retrieve the last 12 months of temperature observation data (tobs).

  * Filtered by the station with the highest number of observations.

  * Ploted the results as a histogram with `bins=12`.

## Step 2 - Climate App

Now that I have completed my initial analysis, I designed a Flask API based on the queries that I have just developed.

* Used FLASK to create my routes.

### Routes

* `/`

  * Home page.

  * List all routes that are available.

* `/api/v1.0/precipitation`

  * Convert the query results to a Dictionary using `date` as the key and `prcp` as the value.

  * Return the JSON representation of your dictionary.

* `/api/v1.0/stations`

  * Return a JSON list of stations from the dataset.

* `/api/v1.0/tobs`
  * query for the dates and temperature observations from a year from the last data point.
  * Return a JSON list of Temperature Observations (tobs) for the previous year.

* `/api/v1.0/<start>` and `/api/v1.0/<start>/<end>`

  * Return a JSON list of the minimum temperature, the average temperature, and the max temperature for a given start or start-end range.

  * When given the start only, calculate `TMIN`, `TAVG`, and `TMAX` for all dates greater than and equal to the start date.

  * When given the start and the end date, calculate the `TMIN`, `TAVG`, and `TMAX` for dates between the start and end date inclusive.

## Hints

* I will joined the station and measurement tables for some of the analysis queries.

* Used Flask `jsonify` to convert your API data into a valid JSON response object.

### Optional: Other Recommended Analyses if you like to tag along this challenge: 

* The following are optional challenge queries. These are highly recommended to attempt, but not required for the challenge. 

### Temperature Analysis I

* Hawaii is reputed to enjoy mild weather all year. Is there a meaningful difference between the temperature in, for example, June and December?

* You may either use SQLAlchemy or pandas's `read_csv()` to perform this portion.

* Identify the average temperature in June at all stations across all available years in the dataset. Do the same for December temperature.

* Use the t-test to determine whether the difference in the means, if any, is statistically significant. Will you use a paired t-test, or an unpaired t-test? Why?

### Temperature Analysis II

* The starter notebook contains a function called `calc_temps` that will accept a start date and end date in the format `%Y-%m-%d` and return the minimum, average, and maximum temperatures for that range of dates.

* Use the `calc_temps` function to calculate the min, avg, and max temperatures for your trip using the matching dates from the previous year (i.e., use "2017-01-01" if your trip start date was "2018-01-01").

* Plot the min, avg, and max temperature from your previous query as a bar chart.

  * Use the average temperature as the bar height.

  * Use the peak-to-peak (tmax-tmin) value as the y error bar (yerr).

### Daily Rainfall Average

* Calculate the rainfall per weather station using the previous year's matching dates.

* Calculate the daily normals. Normals are the averages for the min, avg, and max temperatures.

* You are provided with a function called `daily_normals` that will calculate the daily normals for a specific date. This date string will be in the format `%m-%d`. Be sure to use all historic tobs that match that date string.

* Create a list of dates for your trip in the format `%m-%d`. Use the `daily_normals` function to calculate the normals for each date string and append the results to a list.

* Load the list of daily normals into a Pandas DataFrame and set the index equal to the date.

* Use Pandas to plot an area plot (`stacked=False`) for the daily normals.
